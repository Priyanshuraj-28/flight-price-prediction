# flight-price-prediction
Predicting the price of flights based on multiple factors like airline, route, duration, and total stops. These were the columns:
Airline
Date_of_Journey
Source
Destination
Route
Dep_Time
Arrival_Time
Duration
Total_Stops
Additional_Info
Price (Target column)
I performed EDA on the dataset to find insights about the data that will help in building the model and making business inferences.
Finally, I predicted the price using the XGB regressor with an RÂ² = 0.89.
